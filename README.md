1)Create a function that receives two parameters of integer numeric type the function will perform the following:
It must add the two numbers and if the result of the sum is in the list of numbers return the index where the result is and if the number is not return the value of False.
Example:
(5,6)=5 + 6 = 11
[0,10,22,90,11,26,77] = index = 4
Perform the exercise with the following array:
[90,7,12,33,123,44,55,87,65,33,43,21]

2)Create a function which receives as parameter a string of characters.
You must invert the string without the help of the [-1] operator or default or external python libraries. Once the string is inverted you must verify if the string is palindromic and if it is, return True otherwise return False.

3)Write a program that asks for two words and tells if they rhyme or not. If the last three letters the last three letters match, it has to say that they rhyme. If only the last two letters match If only the last two letters match, it has to say that they rhyme a little and if not, that they don't rhyme.

4)Create a function that receives a list of arrays, the function must perform a bubble method to sort the list from smallest to largest.
